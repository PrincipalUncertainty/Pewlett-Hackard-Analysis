# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

* An identification of likely outcomes based on the expected near-future "silver tsunami" 

## Deliverables supporting employee actions

* Table 1: See 'Retirement Titles' for employees who are born between Jan.1 1952 and Dec. 31, 1955.  This table will provide information on likely retirees and may inform hiring and retirement practices.
* Table 2: See 'Unique Titles' for referencing employee numbers, names, and titles from the 'Retirement Titles' table.
* Table 3: See 'Retiring Titles' table for the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring.
* Table 4: ''Mentorship Eligibility' table for current employees born between Jan. 1 1965 and Dec.31 1965 who may take advantage of mentoring opportunities.

## Summary and Conclusion

* The report has confidently identified the number of retiring employees per title and those employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to ensure continuity in core company positions. It was wise to run this analysis to account for the impact of the "silver tsunami" retirement run.  This analysis may also support other phenomena affected by culture (values in education/jobs), economics (unemployment, bear/bull markets, etc.), and generational features (population fluctuations) if applied appropriately, and similarly may be used delicately to identify usual durations in positions, likely movement within and away from the company based on age and/or title, etc. Keep asking questions!
